Time Complexity Explanation:
Best Case:  
    Only 1 comparison is made when the element is at index 0.  
    → Theoretical: O(1)

Average Case:  
    On average, the key is found after n/2 comparisons.  
    → Theoretical: O(n/2) ≈ O(n)

Worst Case:  
    Either key is at last index or not present — entire list is scanned.  
    → Theoretical: O(n)

Observations:
- Best case always has 1 comparison.
- Average comparisons grow linearly as input size increases.
- Worst case also grows linearly, matching the size of the list.
- The experiment confirms that the linear search has:
    - Best Case: O(1)
    - Average Case: O(n/2)
    - Worst Case: O(n)
- For large data, linear search becomes inefficient.
